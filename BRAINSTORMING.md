I'm Joey ðŸ‘‹, a high school student who loves programming, cybersecurity, and *sometimes* UI design.

I've participated in several hackathons using both Flutter and Next.JS. 

I'm experienced in front-end development, NixOS, 

Additionally, I'm also interested in creating music, designing electronics, spinning pens, and playing rhythm games.
